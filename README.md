# AIPND
This repository contains code and associated files for the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. This repository consists of a number of tutorial notebooks for various coding exercises and programming labs that will be used to supplement the lessons of the course.

## Table Of Contents

### Tutorial Notebooks
* Vectors => [Git LA Vectors Lab]( https://github.com/udacity/linear-algebra/tree/master/vectors_lab "Git LA Vectors Repo")
* Matrix Multiplication => [Git LA Matrix Multiplication]( https://github.com/udacity/linear-algebra/tree/master/matrixMultiplication "Git LA Matrix Mult Repo")
* Linear Combination [Git LA Linear Combination]( https://github.com/udacity/linear-algebra/tree/master/linearCombination "Git LA Linear Combo Repo" )

### Programming Labs
* [Intro to Python Lab - Classifying Images:](https://github.com/udacity/AIPND/tree/master/intropylab-classifying-images "Classifying Images Lab") Determine which CNN architecture model works best at classifying images of dogs and their breeds.

**REMOVE 'Projects' if not applicable**
### Projects
* Image Classifier: Build a Python application that trains an image classifier on a dataset, then predicts new images using the trained model.

## Dependencies

Each directory has a `requirements.txt` describing the minimal dependencies required to run the notebooks in that directory.

### pip

To install these dependencies with pip, you can issue `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

### Conda Environments

You can find Conda environment files for the Linear Algebra Course in the `environments` folder. Note that environment files are platform dependent. - may be removed if not applicable.
