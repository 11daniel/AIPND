# AIPND
This repository contains code and associated files for the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. This repository consists of a number of tutorial notebooks for various coding exercises and programming labs that will be used to supplement the lessons of the course.

## Table Of Contents

### Tutorial Notebooks
* Linear Algebra Essentials
    * [Vectors Lab](https://github.com/udacity/AIPND/tree/master/linearalgebra-vectors_lab "Vectors Lab") Learn how to graph 2D vectors.
    * [Linear Combination Lab](https://github.com/udacity/AIPND/tree/master/linearalgebra-linear_lab "Linear Combination Lab") Learn how to computationally determine a vector's span and solve a simple system of equations.
    * [Linear Mapping](https://github.com/udacity/AIPND/tree/master/linearalgebra-linear_lab "Linear Mapping Labs") Learn how to solve some problems computationally using vectors and matrices.
### Programming Labs
* [Intro to Python Lab - Classifying Images Lab:](https://github.com/udacity/AIPND/tree/master/intropylab-classifying-images "Classifying Images Lab") Determine which CNN architecture model works best at classifying images of dogs and their breeds.


## Dependencies

Each directory has a `requirements.txt` describing the minimal dependencies required to run the notebooks in that directory.

### pip
